Postmortem: Web Service Outage Due to Database Overload
Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage lasted for approximately 2 hours, starting at 10:00 AM UTC and ending at 12:00 PM UTC.
Impact: During the outage, the main web application service was significantly slowed down, and approximately 80% of users experienced timeouts or extremely slow load times. The primary impact was on user login and data retrieval processes.
Root Cause: The root cause was an unexpected spike in database queries due to an unoptimized search feature that resulted in an overload on the database server.
Timeline:
10:00 AM UTC: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating a spike in server response time.
10:05 AM UTC: Engineers began investigating the application server, assuming it was a server resource issue.
10:15 AM UTC: Misleading path: CPU and memory usage on the application server were within normal ranges, which delayed further investigation.
10:30 AM UTC: The team escalated the issue to the database administrators after noticing slow database query times.
10:45 AM UTC: The root cause was identified as an unoptimized search query running on the database.
11:00 AM UTC: A temporary fix was applied by disabling the search feature, which led to the gradual recovery of the service.
12:00 PM UTC: Full service restoration was confirmed after the database load returned to normal levels.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The issue stemmed from an unoptimized search feature that was deployed the previous night. The search query was designed to retrieve large datasets without appropriate indexing, causing a significant increase in database load. The lack of proper indexing and optimization led to the database server becoming overwhelmed, which in turn caused slow response times across the entire application.

Resolution: The immediate resolution involved disabling the search feature to reduce the load on the database. The development team then optimized the query by adding appropriate indexes and rewriting the search algorithm to be more efficient. This reduced the number of database calls and improved query performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements and Fixes:

Optimize Query Performance: Ensure all database queries are optimized, particularly those that handle large datasets.
Implement Comprehensive Testing: Introduce stress testing for new features, especially those interacting heavily with the database.
Database Monitoring: Enhance database monitoring to catch slow queries and high load conditions early.
Indexing Strategy: Review and update the indexing strategy for all database tables regularly.
Specific Tasks:

 Review and patch the search query to optimize performance.
 Conduct a full audit of current database queries and apply necessary indexing.
 Set up automated alerts for slow query detection and high database load.
 Perform load testing on the database after each significant feature update.
 Train the development team on best practices for writing efficient queries.
